# Tracking Data Analysis âš½

## What? ðŸ’»
This repository contains a report on public tracking (and event) data of an anonymized soccer match via Metrica Sports. The report (a Google Slides presentation in the form of a pdf) includes a brief overview of tracking data, then walks through the analysis and concludes with real world use cases. The repository also of course includes the data as well as the Python file used to load, explore, and visualize it. Spyder was the IDE of choice and some relevant packages used were Kloppy, collections, and an (included) imported file Metrica_Viz.

## Why? ðŸ¤”
I am pursuing a career in football/soccer analytics and wanted to create a project that demonstrated my coding ability, knowledge of the game, and presentation skills - all things I see as necessary in the field. I specifically wanted to work with tracking data as I haven't yet worked with it given it is somewhat limited in terms of public accessibility. Also, I wanted to demonstrate my ability to manage and manipulate multiple types of data (event and tracking) in multiple different formats (.csv, .txt, .xml).
